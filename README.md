# Library Management System - Technical Assessment

## Overview

This project is a Library Management System implemented as a kata for the technical assessment conducted by Incubyte at our college campus. The system is designed using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, ensuring all functionalities are tested and implemented to meet specified requirements. Before coding, the problem was initially solved on paper to provide a clear overview and design blueprint.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add new books and increase the number of copies of existing books in the library.
- **Borrow and Return**: Borrow books from the library and return them, with checks on availability.
- **View Available Books**: List all books that are currently available in the library.

## TDD Approach

- Each functionality was first defined with test cases, using JUnit, to specify the expected behavior.
- The implementation was then written to satisfy the test cases, ensuring the code meets all specified requirements before progressing.
- This approach helped maintain a clear and concise development process, with a strong focus on testing.

## Problem-Solving Approach

- The problem was initially addressed on paper to outline the overall structure and functionality of the system.
- This step provided a comprehensive understanding and facilitated a smoother transition into the coding phase.

## Results

All test cases passed, confirming that the system behaves as expected under various scenarios, including edge cases. The system was developed and tested in a structured manner, following TDD principles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- JUnit 4 or 5

### Running the Tests

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the project into your favorite IDE.
3. Run the test suite to validate the implementation.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of the TDD approach in developing a reliable and maintainable Library Management System. The rigorous testing process ensures that the system is robust and meets all functional requirements.
